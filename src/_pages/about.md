title: About
---

I am a full-stack Rails developer at BookBub. My primary focus is in back-end and code design improvements. I love coaching team members to improve their technical abilities. Learning together with my coworkers is a joy. I have a track record of delivering solutions to big problems with small teams.

I prefer working with back-end technologies. I’m most proficient with Ruby. I’ve have recently written Elixir and Golang professionally. I recognize that Javascript exists, and am happy that other people like it. I enjoy solving integration and architecture concerns with projects.

I like speaking at conferences and meetups, writing about what I’ve learned, and talking on podcasts.

I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology (2008) and Bentley University (2010). I have experience in the insurance industry, healthcare technology industry, and consulting.

I’m originally from New Hampshire. I currently live with my wife and daughter outside of Boston, Massachusetts. I support and visit my local greyhound rescue when I can. I’m passionate about very specific musical artists, namely Bruce Springsteen and Nine Inch Nails. I enjoy watching hockey and other people make woodworking projects. Unfortunately, that leaves me with no time to make projects of my own.
